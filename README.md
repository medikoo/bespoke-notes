### Usage

`bespoke-notes` uses `<aside>` elements as notes.

```html
...
<section>
  <h2>My Slide</h2>
  <aside>
    <p>My Notes</p>
  </aside>
</section>
...
```

```javascript
// If your CJS bundler supports CSS modules do:
notes = require('bespoke-notes');
// otherwise do following (and aside ensure that rules from style.css are loaded in your browser)
notes = require('bespoke-notes/dom');

bespoke.from(selector, [
  notes()
]);
```

Possible options:
```javascript
bespoke.from(selector, [
  notes({
    key: 0x4e, // (optional) Key that toggles notes, defaults to 'n'
    visible: false, // (optional) Whether to display notes on startup
  })
]);
```

Additionally notes display can be forced via `?notes` query in url search string
